# N8N Integration Plan for Tampana

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate the Tampana emotion tracking application with your n8n instance at n8n.alw.lol. The integration will allow n8n workflows to interact with emotional data, trigger actions based on emotional patterns, and provide automated insights.

## Current State
- **Tampana App**: React-based emotion tracking application with calendar interface
- **Data Storage**: Currently local browser storage (localStorage)
- **N8N Instance**: Running at n8n.alw.lol on your local server

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Data Export & API Layer
- Create a standardized data export format for n8n consumption
- Implement webhook endpoints for real-time data streaming
- Add REST API endpoints for data retrieval

### 2. N8N Workflow Triggers
- **Emotional Pattern Detection**: Trigger workflows when specific emotional patterns are detected
- **Scheduled Reports**: Generate weekly/monthly emotional wellness reports
- **Threshold Alerts**: Alert workflows when emotional scores fall below certain thresholds
- **Event-Based Triggers**: Trigger workflows on specific emotional events

### 3. N8N Workflow Actions
- **Data Analysis**: Process emotional data for insights
- **External Integrations**: Connect with calendar apps, health platforms, or communication tools
- **Automated Responses**: Send encouraging messages, schedule wellness activities
- **Data Aggregation**: Combine emotional data with other health metrics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create data export utilities
- [ ] Implement webhook system
- [ ] Design API endpoints
- [ ] Add configuration for n8n connection

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement real-time data streaming
- [ ] Create n8n workflow templates
- [ ] Add authentication and security
- [ ] Test basic data flow

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Implement emotional pattern detection
- [ ] Create automated workflow triggers
- [ ] Add data visualization in n8n
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployment to production
- [ ] User training and feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (Tampana)
- Add n8n configuration panel
- Implement webhook registration
- Create data export interfaces
- Add real-time data streaming

### Backend/API
- REST API endpoints
- Webhook management
- Data transformation utilities
- Authentication system

### N8N Workflows
- Data ingestion workflows
- Pattern analysis workflows
- Action workflows (notifications, integrations)
- Reporting workflows

## Data Flow
1. **User logs emotion** in Tampana
2. **Data is processed** and formatted for n8n
3. **Webhook is triggered** to n8n instance
4. **N8N workflow processes** the emotional data
5. **Actions are executed** based on workflow logic
6. **Results are stored** or sent to external systems

## Security Considerations
- API key authentication
- Data encryption in transit
- Rate limiting
- Access control for sensitive emotional data
- GDPR compliance for personal data

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Webhook delivery success rates
- Workflow execution metrics
- Data processing performance
- Error tracking and alerting

## Success Metrics
- Successful webhook deliveries
- Workflow execution times
- User engagement with n8n features
- Data accuracy and completeness
- System reliability and uptime

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Create initial n8n workflow templates
5. Test integration with your n8n instance
